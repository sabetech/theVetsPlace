Setting up the vetsplace management system
The database name for this project is thevetsplace

The file containing the configuration for the database is in

the file ".../functional/theVetsDB_API" . you can change the parameters there to enable you connect to the database.

The application was built from the ground with no php frameworks but adhering to the Model-View-Controller model(MVC) of the web application development.

I used a CSS library (Metro UI CSS) and of course JQuery :)

The default user name and password is

username: "user"
password: "user"

Still working on it though trying to add more features
The sms feature is currently inactive
