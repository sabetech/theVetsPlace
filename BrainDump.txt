Ans: each category will be an accordion already opened or Injectables already opened

<items>
	<injectables>
		<item1> name and stuff</item1>
	</injectables>
</items>

{"curItems":
	[{"injectables":[{"itemName":"item1","itemQty":"27"}
					 {"itemName":"item2","itemQty":"29"}
					 {"itemName":"item3","itemQty":"32"}
					]}, 
	 {"Vaccines":[{"itemName":"item1","itemQty":"27"}
				  {"itemName":"item2","itemQty":"29"}
				  {"itemName":"item3","itemQty":"32"}
				  ]
	  }
	]
}
