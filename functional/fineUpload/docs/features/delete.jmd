# Deleting Files {: .page-header }

Enabling the deletion of files means your users can delete files after they have been uploaded.
You can only delete files that have been uploaded during the current session.
If you upload a file, leave the page, and come back then you cannot delete that file though Fine Uploader.

A file is eligible for deletion only after it has been successfully uploaded.

## Options

#### `deleteFile` option

{{ options_table(
    (
        ("enabled", "`Boolean`", "`false`", "Set to `true` if users should be able to delete files."),
        ("method", "`String`", "`'DELETE'`", "Set the HTTP method to use for delete. You may also set this to POST"),
        ("endpoint", "`String`", "`'/server/upload'`", "The endpoint where the delete request is sent."),
        ("customHeaders", "`Object`", "`{}`", "Specify any additional headers to attach to all delete requests."),
        ("params", "`Object`", "`{}`", "Specify any additonal parameters to attach to all delete requests.")
    )
) }}

{{
alert("""Fine Uploader appends a `_delete` parameter to the request object when the HTTP method is POST instead of DELETE.
This is for your benefit so your server knows what sort of request it is.""")
}}

## Events

    (
        ("delete", "`Integer` id", "Called just before a delete request is sent for the associated item."),
        ("deleteComplete", "`Integer` id, `XMLHttpRequest` or `XDomainRequest` xhrOrXdr, `Boolean` isError", "Called just after receiving a request from the server for a delete file request."),
        ("submitDelete", "`Integer` id", "Called just before an item that has been marked for deletion has been submitted to the uploader. You may return false to prevent the delete.

    )
) }}

{{ methods_table(
    (
