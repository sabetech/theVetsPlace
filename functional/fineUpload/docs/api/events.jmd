# Events <small>Traditional & S3</small> {: .page-header }

Fine Uploader's event system enables integrators to execute any operations at
almost any point in the upload process. Knowing how these callbacks work, and
when they are called, is crucial to unlocking the full potential of
Fine Uploader.

#### autoRetry

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name, String attemptNumber

Called before each automatic retry attempt for a failed item.

----

#### cancel

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name

Called when the item has been cancelled.

Return `false` to prevent the upload from being cancelled. Also can return a
`qq.Promise` if non-blocking work is required
here. Calling `failure()` on the promise is equivalent to returning `false`.
If using a Promise, then processing of the cancel request will be
deferred until the promise is fullfilled. Since there is no way to "pause"
the upload in progress while waiting for the promise to be fullfilled the
upload may actually complete until the promise has actually be fullfilled.

----

#### complete

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name, Object responseJSON, XMLHttpRequest xhr

Called when the item has finished uploading.

The responseJSON will contain the raw response from the server including the
"success" property which indicates whether the upload succeeded or not.

{{ alert(
"""The `xhr` parameter will only be included if this request was initiated by
an `XMLHttpRequest` (see [Browser Support](../browser-support.html)).""", "info", "Note") }}

----

#### delete

**Parameters**: Integer id

Called just before a delete request is sent for the associated item.

----

#### deleteComplete

**Parameters**: Integer id, XMLHttpRequest xhr, Boolean isError

Called just after receiving a response from the server for a delete file
request.


{{ alert(
"""When using browsers that do not provide an `XMLHttpRequest` object,
the `xhr` parameter will be an `XDomainRequest` instead.""", "failure", "Note") }}

----

#### error

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name, String errorReason, XMLHttpRequest xhr

Called whenever an exceptional condition occurs (see [Handling Errors](../features/handling-errors.html))

{{ alert(
"""The `xhr` parameter will only be included if this request was initiated by
an `XMLHttpRequest` (see [Browser Support](../browser-support.html)).""", "info", "Note") }}

----

#### manualRetry

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name

Called before each manual retry attempt.

Return `false` to prevent this an all future retry attempts on the associated item.

----

#### pasteReceived

**Parameters**: Blob blob

Called when a pasted image has been received (before upload).

The pasted image is represented as a `Blob`. Also can return a `qq.Promise` if non-blocking work is required
here. If using a Promise the value of the success parameter must be the name
to associate with the pasted image. If the associated attempt is marked a
`failure` then you should include a string explaining the reason in your
`failure` callback for the Promise.

{{ alert(
"""The `promptForName` option, if `true`, will effectively wipe away any custom implementation of this callback. The two are not meant to be used together. This callback is meant to provide an alternative means to provide a name for a pasted image. If you are using Fine Uploader Core mode then you can display your own prompt for the name by overriding the default implementation of this callback.""", "info", "Note") }}

----

#### progress

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name, int uploadedBytes, int totalBytes

Called during the upload, as it progresses.

For chunked uploads, this will be called for each chunk.

Only used by the AJAX uploader.

----

#### resume

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name, Object chunkData

Called just before a file upload is resumed.  See the `uploadChunk` event for more info on the `ChunkData` object.  

----

#### statusChange

**Parameters**: Integer id, String oldStatus, String newStatus

Invoked whenever the status changes for any item submitted to the uploader.

The status values correspond to those found in the `qq.status` object.
For reference, the status':

* `SUBMITTED`
* `QUEUED`
* `UPLOADING`
* `UPLOAD_RETRYING`
* `UPLOAD_FAILED`
* `UPLOAD_SUCCESSFUL`
* `CANCELLED`
* `REJECTED`
* `DELETED`
* `DELETING`
* `DELETE_FAILED`

----

#### submit

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name

Called when the item has been selected and is a candidate for uploading.

This
does not mean the item is going to be uploaded. Return `false` to prevent
submission to the uploader. A `qq.Promise` can be used if non-blocking work is
required. Processing of this item is deferred until the promise is fullfilled.
If a promise is returned, a call to `failure` is the same as returning `false`.

----

#### submitDelete

**Parameters**: Integer id

Called before an item has been marked for deletion has been submitted to the
uploader.

A `qq.Promise` can be used if non-blocking work is required.
Processing of this item is deferred until the promise is fullfilled.
If a promise is returned, a call to `failure` is the same as returning `false`.

----

#### submitted

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name

Called when the item has been successfully submitted to the uploader.

The file will upload immediately if there is a) at least one free connection
(see: [`maxConnections` option](options.html#maxconnections)) and b) `autoUpload`
is set to `true` (see [`autoUpload` option](options.html#autoupload)).

The callback is invoked after the 'submit' event is handled without returning a
`false` value. In Fine Uploader Core mode it is usually safe to assume that
the associated elements in the UI representing the associated file have already
been added to the DOM immediately before this callback is invoked.

----

#### upload

**Parameters**: Integer id, String name

Called just before an item beings uploading to the server.

----

#### uploadChunk

**Parameters:** Integer id, String name, Object chunkData

Called just before a chunk requset is sent.

The `chunkData` object, which is passed into the 'uploadChunk' event handler, has 4 properties:

* `partIndex` - the 0-based index of the associated partition.
* `startByte` - the byte offset of the current chunk.
* `endByte` - the last byte of the current chunk.
* `totalParts` - the total number of partitions associated with the `File` or `Blob`.

----

#### validate

**Parameters**: FileOrBlobData fileOrBlobData

Called once for each selected, dropped, or `addFiles` submitted file and for
each `addBlobs` submitted `Blob`.

This callback is always invoked before the default Fine Uploader validators
execute.

This event will not be called if you return `false` in your `validateBatch` event
handler, or if the `stopOnFirstInvalidFile` validation option is `true` and
the `validate` event handler has returned `false` for an item.

A `qq.Promise` can be used if non-blocking work is required.
Processing of this item is deferred until the promise is fullfilled.
If a promise is returned, a call to `failure` is the same as returning `false`.

{{ alert(
"""The `BlobData` object has two properties: `name` and `size`. The `size`
property will be undefined for browsers without File API support.""", "info", "Note") }}

----

#### validateBatch

**Parameters**: Array fileOrBlobDataArray

This callback is always invoked before the default Fine Uploader validators
execute.

This event will not be called if you return `false` in your `validateBatch` event
handler, or if the `stopOnFirstInvalidFile` validation option is `true` and
the `validate` event handler has returned `false` for an item.

A `qq.Promise` can be used if non-blocking work is required.
Processing of this item is deferred until the promise is fullfilled.
If a promise is returned, a call to `failure` is the same as returning `false`.

{{ alert(
"""The FileOrBlobData object has two properties: `name` and `size`. The `size`
property will be undefined for browsers without File API support.""", "info", "Note") }}
