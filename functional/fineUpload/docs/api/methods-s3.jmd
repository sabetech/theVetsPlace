## S3

The S3 uploader provides many of the same API methods as the traditional
uploader, but there are a few crucial differences to take into account.
If you plan to use the S3 uploader, then use the following table as your API
reference.  All methods outlined in the core or UI documentation are also available
in Fine Uploader S3, unless otherwise noted here.

{{ methods_table(
(
    ("getKey", "`Integer` fileId", "`String`", "Retreive the S3 object key with the associated id"),
    ("getResumableFilesData", "", "`Object`", "Retrieve information about files that may be resumed during this session.
    Includes all properties documented in the associated [core method](methods.html#core), as well as a `key` property."),
    ("setEndpoint", "`String` bucketPath[, `Number` id]", "", "Modify the bucket where upload requests should be directed.
    The endpoint for a specific file or blob can be changed by passing in an optional `id` parameter.
    All valid bucket URLs documented by Amazon are supported, including custom domains. SSL is also supported.")
)
) }}
